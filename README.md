- 👋 Hi, I’m @Elettrough

- 🌱 I’m currently following Harward course CS50’s Understanding Technology on EdX Platform. After this, I plan to continue with the course CS50's Introduction to Computer Science.
- 💞️ I’m opening this profile in order to share my progress and, when I will learn enough, my projects.
- ✨ I have experience with MATLAB, since I used it for computations and process simulations during my Chemical Engineering studies at University.
